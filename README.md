# Anki-Addons
This repository is used to store all kinds of anki addons that I created

Resize / Scale the pasted Images in Anki.

## [PurgeAttributes](https://searene.github.io/2016/02/14/PurgeAttributes-an-Anki-addon-to-purge-unnecessary-attributes/)

PurgeAttributes in Anki. For example, you can remove the background, the default font settings, line-height etc. in Anki.

## [GoldenDictMedia](https://searene.github.io/2016/02/14/GoldenDictMedia/)

Automatically import the images and audios pasted from Goldendict.

## [WriteToDisk](https://searene.github.io/2016/04/13/WriteToDisk/)

Save data every time a card is added or reviewed, avoid losing data when anki or system crashes.

## PurgeBrE

This is a simple addon to remove the British pronunciation in the Longman DOCE 5th dictionary.

# How to use it

Put the respective `.py` file in your Anki addon folder and restart it. Some of these addons are uploaded to [ankiweb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/), you can install them from there directly.

# Known Issues

PurgeAttributes is ridiculously slow on Windows. Haven't found a solution yet.
